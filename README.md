An old code added to GitHub years later it was written. Code was written in 2014.

Reads in .rpt files generated by Microsot SQL Server 2012 and converts them to easily handlable txt files.

I used this code for my [masters thesys](http://adamrudolf.web.elte.hu/MSc_szakdolgozat.pdf) as a helper.

Sorry for not including any instructions or descriptions, the purpose of this repo is to save the code to the future in a presentable way. As I remember I used Visual Studio to develop it.
